# D-Lab Command Line Workshop

This repository contains the materials for D-Lab Command Line workshop. 

### Prerequisites
No prior experience in either Bash or Git is necessary.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!

## Workshop Goals

In this workshop, we provide a basic introduction to how to interact with your computer via terminal. We are going to focus on Bash(Bourne-Again SHell) or Zsh(Z shell), which are one of the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells. This workshop is designed to be 1-hour long. 

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the role of the command shell in operating system interactions.
- Understand and navigate through directories and paths.
- Practice creating, moving, and deleting files and directories.
- Use pipes and redirection to combine commands.

## Installation Instructions

Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have gone through these instructions.

You'll need to make sure we can use bash on your computer. 

* **Windows:** You can install BASH emulator, `Git BASH` via [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org). When you are installing Git, choose "Use the Nano editor by default" 
* **Mac:** We can use Terminal on Mac. Applications > Terminal
* **Linux:** We can use Terminal on most Linux machines. Applications > Terminal

## Is Command Line/Bash not Working on Your Computer?

If you do not have Bash installed and the materials loaded on your
workshop by the time it starts, we *strongly* recommend using the UC Berkeley
Datahub to run the materials for these lessons. You can access the DataHub by
clicking the following button:

[![DataHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/launch-datahub-blue)](DATAHUB_LINK_HERE)

The DataHub downloads this repository, along with any necessary packages, and
allows you to run the materials in an RStudio instance on UC Berkeley's servers.
No installation is necessary from your end - you only need an internet browser
and a CalNet ID to log in. By using the DataHub, you can save your work and come
back to it at any time. When you want to return to your saved work, just go
straight to the [D-Lab DataHub](https://dlab.datahub.berkeley.edu), sign in, and
you click on the `Command-Line` folder.

If you don't have a Berkeley CalNet ID, you can still run these lessons in the cloud, by clicking this button:

By using this button, however, you cannot save your work.
