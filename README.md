# D-Lab Command Line Fundamentals

This repository contains the materials for D-Lab Command Line Fundamentals workshop. 

### Prerequisites
No prior experience in either command line or bash is necessary.

Check D-Lab's [Learning Pathways](https://dlab-berkeley.github.io/dlab-workshops/python_path.html) to figure out which of our workshops to take!

## Workshop Goals

In this 1-hour workshop, we provide a basic introduction interacting with your computer via the terminal. We focus on Bash(Bourne-Again SHell) or Zsh(Z shell), which are among the most commonly used Unix/Linux shells. 

## Learning Objectives

After this workshop, you will be able to:

- Understand the role of the command shell in operating system interactions.
- Understand and navigate through directories and paths.
- Practice creating, moving, and deleting files and directories.
- Use pipes and redirection to combine commands.

## Installation Instructions

Before attending the workshop, please ensure you have gone through these instructions.

You'll need to make sure we can use bash on your computer. 

* **Windows:** You can install BASH emulator, `Git BASH` via [git for Windows](https://gitforwindows.org). When you are installing Git, choose "Use the Nano editor by default". If you already have another BASH emulator installed (e.g. WSL), we can use your installed program instead.
* **Mac:** We can use Terminal on Mac. Applications > Terminal
* **Linux:** We can use Terminal on most Linux machines. Applications > Terminal
